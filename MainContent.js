                    So my favorite sport is playing tennis, I have played tennis since I was 10 years old. I went every monday and wednesday
                    to the tennis club to play with my friends. Then, when I turned 17 years old, I stopped playing tennis and started
                    playing volleyball at school with my classmates, and we went every saturday to compete with other spanish schools.
                    Nowadays, I usually go to the gym and sometimes I play tennis at the UCR gym.
                    Moreover, I love to cook, in my family, my dad is the one who cooks at home, so he teach me since I was little how to
                    cook typical spanish dishes, like paella or lentejas estofadas.
