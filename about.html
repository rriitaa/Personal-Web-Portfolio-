            <h2>About Me: </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Rita, I am from Madrid, Spain, I am currently studying computer engineering in Riverside,
                California, for one full academic year.
                I started here at UCR the last fall 2023 quarter. I attended highschool at KingÂ´s College, a british school in Madrid.
                Moreover, comming to California, has been a wish come true, I have enjoyed this so much.
                Later on, I will graduate back in Spain, and I will do an intership in Madrid,
                and it will be in Deloitte, KPMG, Google or IBM.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            My goals represent a mix of both modest aspirations and ambitious dreams. 
            Completing my career in computer engineering is a fundamental goal rooted in a passion for technology and the desire to
            contribute to advancements in the field.
            The idea of interning at Deloitte was inspired by a recognition of the valuable experiences gained from working in 
            a leading consulting firm and the chance to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.
            Becoming the CEO of IBM is undoubtedly an ambitious goal, driven by a vision of leadership, innovation, 
            and making a significant impact on the tech industry. 
            Writing a book about artificial intelligence reflects a commitment to sharing knowledge and insights with a broader audience,
            contributing to the discourse on this transformative technology.
            The goal of having a big family is deeply personal, rooted in a love for companionship and the belief in the importance of
            strong family bonds. While some goals may be considered ambitious, each one represents a meaningful pursuit that aligns 
            with my values and aspirations. 
            If money and time were no object, my dream goal would be to establish a foundation dedicated to advancing education and
            technology in underprivileged communities, making a positive and lasting impact on society.

            <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                So my favorite sport is playing tennis, I have played tennis since I was 10 years old. I went every monday and wednesday
                to the tennis club to play with my friends. Then, when I turned 17 years old, I stopped playing tennis and started
                playing volleyball at school with my classmates, and we went every saturday to compete with other spanish schools.
                Nowadays, I usually go to the gym and sometimes I play tennis at the UCR gym.
                Moreover, I love to cook, in my family, my dad is the one who cooks at home, so he teach me since I was little how to
                cook typical spanish dishes, like paella or lentejas estofadas.
            </p>

            <h2>About UCR and me</h2>
            <p>
                As I am an international Extension Student, there are some classes and activities that I cannot do, because UCR does
                not let us. but I will love to join maybe a sorority or the tennis club, so I can meet new people and hang out with them.
                Moreover, I know that there is a surfing club here at UCR, and some weekends they go to the beach to surf, and
                I will love to go to a californian beach and try surfing.
                Furthermore, something that I will really want to do is go to visit LA or San Diego and go partying there with my friends,
                beacuse they have told me that parties in LA and San Diego are super fun!
